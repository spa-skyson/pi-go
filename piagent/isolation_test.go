// was built. That separation is only real if the import graph enforces it: one
// convenience that resolves a provider, looks up a key or picks an endpoint
// would put provider handling on this package's public surface, and every
// future change to providers would become a breaking change here.
//
// pimodels is on the list from the other direction. The two packages are
// siblings that compose in the embedder's code; if either imports the other
// they are one package with extra steps.
