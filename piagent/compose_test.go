// This file is the one place the two public packages meet. It lives in the
// external piagent_test package deliberately: an embedder imports both, but
// neither production package imports the other, and the isolation guards in
// each package assert exactly that on the build graph. `go list -deps` does not
// follow test files, so this composition cannot weaken either guard — a fact
// TestComposeDoesNotWeakenIsolation pins rather than assumes.

// TestComposeModelIntoAgent is the quickstart from both READMEs, executed.
// If this breaks, the documented two-line embed is wrong, and no amount of
// per-package coverage would have caught it.
