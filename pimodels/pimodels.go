// Package pimodels builds LLM clients for the providers pi-go supports, for use
// from outside pi-go.
//
// It resolves a model name to a provider, finds the API key, and returns a
// [Model] — the ADK interface an agent consumes. That is the whole remit.
//
// # Isolation
//
// This package knows about models and providers. It knows nothing about agents,
// tools, sessions or skills, and it must stay that way: an embedder composes the
// two halves itself.
//
//	m, err := pimodels.New(ctx, "gpt-5.6-luna")
//	if err != nil {
//	    return err
//	}
//	a, err := piagent.New(ctx, piagent.WithModel(m))
//
// Because both packages meet at ADK's model.LLM rather than at each other,
// neither imports the other, and a change to provider handling cannot become a
// breaking change to the agent API.
//
// # API keys
//
// [New] reads the key from the provider's environment variable — OPENAI_API_KEY,
// ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, AZUREOPENAI_API_KEY, or <PROVIDER>_API_KEY
// for the rest. [WithAPIKey] overrides that. Providers that need no key, such as
// a local Ollama, work with neither set.
//
// Nothing here reads pi-go's config file. [FromConfig] does, explicitly, for
// embedders that want the same model a `pi` session would pick.
//
// # Tracing
//
// [WithTraceSink] records the HTTP traffic of one client and delivers it to a
// callback, without touching process-global state. pi-go's own --trace-http
// machinery is not usable from an embedder: it needs httplog.SetEnabled and a
// globally installed sink, and the global sink is a single slot a library has no
// business claiming.
