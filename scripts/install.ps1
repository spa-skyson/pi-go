# pi-rate installer for Windows.
#
# Works on Windows PowerShell 5.1 (Windows 10/11 built-in) and PowerShell 7+;
# no bash, curl aliases, or && chains — everything uses cmdlets available in
# 5.1. Downloads the latest pi-rate windows/amd64 release zip and installs
# pirate.exe into %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs, adding that directory to the user PATH
# when missing.
#
# Usage:
#   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
#   or one line from an existing shell:
#   powershell -NoProfile -Command "iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spa-skyson/pi-rate/main/scripts/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex"

# Older Windows PowerShell 5.1 images default to TLS 1.0/1.1, which GitHub
# rejects: the download then hangs or fails with "The underlying connection was
# closed".
#
# Only force TLS 1.2 when the process is pinned to something older. A current
# build reports SystemDefault, meaning "let the OS negotiate", which already
# reaches TLS 1.2 and can reach 1.3 — and `SystemDefault -bor Tls12` would
# replace that with a hard TLS 1.2 pin, giving up 1.3 to fix a problem the
# machine does not have.

# --- Verify the download against the release checksums -------------------------
# checksums.txt is a GoReleaser artifact listing "<sha256>  <filename>" for every
# archive in the release. Checking it catches a truncated or corrupted download
# and a swapped asset, which is what an installer can check on its own.
#
# It is not proof of origin: checksums.txt travels the same path as the archive,
# so anyone who could substitute one could substitute both. `pirate verify` is the
# check that answers that — it looks the binary's digest up in GitHub's
# attestations API and verifies the Sigstore bundle against this repo's release
# workflow. The last line of this script points at it.
#
# Missing or unlisted checksums are a hard failure rather than a warning. A
# release without them is a broken release, and an installer that shrugs and
# continues is an installer whose verification means nothing.
