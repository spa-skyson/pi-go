// The stash lifecycle
//
// Create takes a stash so that `git worktree add` sees a clean tree. That
// entry holds the *user's* uncommitted work — not the agent's, which lives on
// the worktree branch — and for as long as it exists the working tree no
// longer holds a copy of it. One rule follows, and every disposal site in this
// file obeys it:
//
//	An entry Create pushed may leave the stash list only after it has been
//	successfully applied back to the working tree. Every other exit — a failed
//	`worktree add`, a failed apply, a run abandoned before MergeBack — leaves
//	the entry where the user can see it and reports why.
//
// `git stash drop` on an entry that was never applied is therefore never
// correct here: it deletes the content instead of restoring it, leaving it
// reachable only as a dangling commit until gc. A stash list with one extra
// entry in it is cheap; the work inside that entry is not.

// errStashEntryGone reports that no stash entry carries the requested message.
// Callers for which a vanished entry is benign — MergeBack and cleanupWorktree
// both run after something else may already have restored it — filter it out
// with errors.Is. Create does not: it pushed the entry moments earlier, so its
// absence there means something went wrong.

// then removes it from the stash list. A failed apply leaves the entry in
// place, per "The stash lifecycle" above.
//
// The entry is located by message rather than assumed to sit at stash@{0}:
// anything else with access to the repo — the user, an editor plugin, another
// pi-go agent — can push a stash between our push and our pop, and applying
// the top entry blindly would then restore someone else's work over the
// working tree while leaving ours behind. A message that matches no entry is
// reported as errStashEntryGone; it never falls back to whatever happens to be
// on top.
//
// Both git commands address the entry by its immutable object id wherever git
// allows it, because `stash@{N}` is positional: an external push or drop
// between our lookup and our command renumbers every entry beneath it. Apply
// takes the object id directly. Drop does not accept one ("is not a stash
// reference"), so the ref is re-resolved and its object id re-checked
// immediately beforehand; if it no longer names the entry we just applied we
