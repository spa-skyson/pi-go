// spawns) can be killed together.
//
// This delegates to internal/procs rather than hand-rolling
// kill(-cmd.Process.Pid, SIGKILL), which assumed the group ID equals the
// child's PID and never checked that the PID was still ours to signal. See
// internal/procs/procs_unix.go for why signaling a stale PID is dangerous.
