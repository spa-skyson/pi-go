// It exists because the engine does not offer the obvious thing. RunState lives
// on an unexported scheduler and is never handed to a caller, and node *start*
// is not an event at all. What is observable is the stream: our node bodies
// announce themselves on entry (exec.StageStarted), a paused node carries
// RequestedInput, and a failure arrives as an error. Completion is inferred —
// a node has finished once the next one begins, which the scheduler guarantees
// by only scheduling a successor after its predecessor completes.
