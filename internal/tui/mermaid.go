// mermaidStyleFor maps a diagram's semantic style key onto the active palette.
//
// The goal is that the three structural roles read apart at a glance, because
// a diagram where boxes, connectors and groups share one grey is just a texture:
//
//   - a box is chrome, so it takes the neutral Overlay grey and stays back;
//   - its text is the content, so it takes the full-strength Text;
//   - a connector is flow, so it takes Primary — a hue, not a grey, which is
//     what lets the eye trace an edge across a crowded diagram;
//   - a group is an enclosure, so its border and its title share Accent, which
//     ties a caption to the box it names;
//   - an edge label is an annotation on a connector, so it takes Peach: warm,
//     and distinct from both the blue it sits on and the grey behind it.
//
// The renderer emits no "arrow" key — arrowheads are drawn as "edge" — so
// arrowheads inherit the connector color, which is what we want anyway.
