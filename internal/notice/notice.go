// Package notice carries short, user-facing messages raised while pi-go starts
// up or reconfigures itself — a skipped MCP server, a rerouted docs source, a
// blocked skill, an OAuth re-login.
//
// These are not diagnostics, and os.Stderr is the wrong place for them once a
// front end owns the terminal: the TUI paints its frame with direct cursor
// control, so a stray write lands in the middle of the layout and stays there
// until the next full repaint, and the ACP server interleaves them with its
// protocol stream. Routing them through a sink lets the front end render them
// where the user is already looking.
//
// The default sink writes to os.Stderr, which is correct for the
// non-interactive CLI: nothing else owns the terminal, and a warning that
// vanished entirely would be worse than one that scrolls past.
