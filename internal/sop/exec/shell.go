// RetryExitCode is the exit status a stage script uses to say "not yet" rather
// than "failed".
//
// The distinction cannot be expressed by success and failure alone, and it is
// the difference between a poll and a defeat: a `watch` stage that finds CI
// still running has not failed, it simply has no answer yet, and what it wants
// is the engine's backoff — not the SOP's failure edge. The value is sysexits'
// EX_TEMPFAIL, which already means exactly this.

//
// It is the piece that lets a SOP be written in YAML alone. A function stage
// runs its `run:` script and reports the route its exit status implies; an
// agent stage is handed to Agent, which the caller supplies because dispatching
// one needs the orchestrator and this package must not depend on it.
//
// Exit status is the contract:
//
//	0                 PASS — take the stage's PASS route, or its forward path
//	RetryExitCode     not ready — return an error so the engine backs off and
//	                  runs the stage again, which is how polling is expressed
//	anything else     FAIL — take the stage's FAIL route
