// The question tool: the model asks the user a multiple-choice question and
// blocks until the interactive session answers it. The bridge is the same
// shape as the permission gate's approval round-trip: the tool hands a
// QuestionRequest to a caller-supplied notifier and parks on req.Reply, the
// TUI dialog answers it once. With no notifier (headless, one-shot, subagent
// runs) the tool never blocks — it returns canceled with a note telling the
// model to decide itself and proceed, so advertising it can never hang a run
// that has no one to answer.

// maxQuestionOptions caps the option list: past ~8 alternatives the dialog
// stops being a quick choice and the model should narrow them first.
