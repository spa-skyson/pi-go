// NewGemini creates a Gemini model.LLM using ADK Go's native Gemini support.
//
// apiKey is the caller's key and wins when set; an empty value falls back to
// GEMINI_API_KEY or GOOGLE_API_KEY, and then to Application Default
// Credentials. Taking the key as a parameter — rather than reading the
// environment unconditionally — is what every sibling provider already does
// (NewOpenAI, NewAnthropic, NewXAI, NewOllama), and it is the only way a
// caller can point the SDK at a proxy that substitutes its own key. Without
// it, a caller-supplied key was silently ignored and the environment was
// consulted instead, so a request meant for one credential went out with
// another.
//
// A key is still REQUIRED to build a client: the SDK refuses with "api key is
// required for Google AI backend" when none is available. The gateway path
// therefore passes a placeholder, because there the gateway injects the real
// key itself (see newAgentGatewayGemini).
//
// If baseURL is non-empty, it overrides the default API endpoint.

// request got no retry at all — not even for a dropped connection. It is set
// low rather than at the SDK's default of 5 because it is the inner of two
// nets and the two multiply: geminiRetryModel re-sends the whole request up to
// five more times on top of whatever happens here.
//
// Three is the split that matches what each net is good at. The SDK retries
// blind, on a fixed exponential schedule that cannot read the server's own
// "retry in 13s" hint, so it is useful for faults that clear in a second or
// two — a reset connection, a timeout, a 5xx blip — and close to useless for a
// per-minute quota window. Two quick retries here cover those, and the outer
// net, which does honor the server's window, owns the rate-limit case.
//
// 429 is deliberately left in the SDK's retryable set even so, because a
// non-streaming call (commit messages, summaries) never reaches the outer net
// and would otherwise have nothing retrying it.

// coarse per-run retry in internal/agent, which refuses once a turn has
// yielded anything — so a rate limit arriving after the turn's first tool call
// ended the turn, even though the error named the seconds to wait.
