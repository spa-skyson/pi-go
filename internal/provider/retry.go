// streamAttempt runs one streaming request, forwarding responses to yield.
type streamAttempt func(yield func(*model.LLMResponse, error) bool)

// streamRetry is the budget for re-sending a request that died before it
// produced anything: five retries, paced 3s, 5s, 7s, 15s, 30s. It retries a
// single HTTP request, so it runs inside whatever timeout the caller already
// set for the turn. A server-supplied rate-limit window still overrides the
// pace.
//
// The schedule is two schedules, because it serves two populations of failure.
//
// The first three delays are short and linear, unchanged, for the faults this
// was originally built for: a dropped socket, a reset stream, a 5xx blip.
// Those clear in seconds, and waiting longer only makes a recoverable turn
// feel broken.
//
// The last two are long because the other population is a per-minute quota
// window, and a retry that lands inside the window that just rejected it is a
// wasted attempt. Cumulatively the five attempts go out at roughly 3s, 8s,
// 15s, 30s and 60s after the first failure, so the budget is not spent before
// the window has had a chance to reopen — which is what three retries totaling
// 15s did against a Gemini rejection asking for 11s. 30s is also the largest
// delay worth naming here: retry.DefaultConfig caps any wait at 60s, so a
// longer entry would be clamped rather than honored.
//
// Five also matches retry.DefaultConfig's MaxRetries, so the per-request and
// per-run budgets no longer disagree about how many attempts a failure gets.
//
// It is a package variable so the provider tests, which drive real error
// responses through httptest servers, can shrink the pauses instead of paying
// the full backoff in wall clock. See TestMain.

// The "before emitting anything" condition is what makes this safe, and it is
// why the retry lives here rather than around the agent run. A provider reports
// a stream failure as a content-less LLMResponse carrying ErrorCode — see
// oaiRunStreaming — with a nil Go error, so nothing upstream can tell a failed
// request from a finished one. Catching it at the source means a rate-limited
// request is re-sent on its own, with the turn's tool calls and partial text
// left untouched; once any of those have been forwarded, the attempt is
// committed and the error passes straight through.
