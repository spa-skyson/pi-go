// defaultOpenAIThinkingLevel is the reasoning effort a coding agent gets when
// the caller names none.
//
// Medium, because that is OpenAI's own recommendation for all-round interactive
// coding work: the Codex prompting guide names medium as the balanced default
// and reserves higher effort for multi-file design changes and hard debugging.
// The alternative — leaving the field off — is not neutral on this family:
// gpt-5.1+ defaults to no reasoning, which is the wrong floor for an agent that
// plans, edits and verifies.

// parameter. Everything else rejects it with a 400 rather than ignoring it:
//
//	400 Unsupported parameter: 'reasoning.effort' is not supported with this model.
//
// That makes this gate load-bearing rather than cosmetic. The Responses path is
// reachable for every model with multi-turn state (see endpointMode), so a
// non-reasoning model — gpt-4.1, gpt-4o — does reach it, and sending the field
// there would break the turn outright instead of degrading the setting.

// oaiReasoningEffortFor maps pi-go's thinking level onto a reasoning effort,

//
// Measured against the live API, the accepted tiers are not uniform. "ok" is

//
//	model             none  low  medium  high  xhigh  max
//	gpt-5.1           ok    ok   ok      ok    REJ    REJ
//	gpt-5.4 / 5.5     ok    ok   ok      ok    ok     REJ
//	gpt-5.6-luna/sol  ok    ok   ok      ok    ok     ok
//	gpt-6-astra/luna  REJ   ok   ok      ok    ok     ok

// low/medium/high are the only tiers every reasoning model accepts, so those
// pass through unchanged and anything outside the band steps inward to the
// nearest accepted tier. Two cases need care:
//
//   - "none" is a real request to switch reasoning off, not an extreme to
//     smooth away. gpt-5.1–5.6 accept it, and pi-go's auxiliary callers — the
//     commit-message writer, ping and the eval judge — pass it for exactly that
//     reason. It is only stepped up to "low" where the family rejects it
//     (o-series, gpt-5 base, gpt-6), which is the same compromise
//     xaiReasoningEffort documents for Grok's missing off switch.
//   - "max"/"xhigh" step down to "high", which every family accepts, because
//     the 400 a rejected top tier earns would break the turn.
//
// Stepping is silent by design: a tier the model cannot express is the model's
// limitation, and the alternative is a 400 naming a parameter the caller never
// typed, which reads as a pi-go bug.
//
// An unrecognized level returns false so the field is omitted and the model's
// own default stands, which is what ThinkingUnset means everywhere else.
