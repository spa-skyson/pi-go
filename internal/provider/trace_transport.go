// traceTransport records every request and response passing through it —
// method, URL, full headers and body — into internal/httplog, which fans them
// out to the session log and to OpenTelemetry span events.
//
// It is installed by BuildTransport as the *innermost* wrapper — below
// headerTransport — so it observes the request as it actually goes on the wire.
// Sitting above headerTransport would log a request missing every ExtraHeader
// the server went on to receive.
//
// Capture is re-checked per round trip rather than only at construction, so
// enabling the trace does not depend on having been decided before the LLM
// client was built.
//
// sink, when non-nil, is the per-client destination and makes capture
// independent of httplog.Enabled(). Entries still go to httplog.Emit as well:
// with capture disabled that is a no-op, and with it enabled it keeps the OTel
// span events and the global JSONL sink working exactly as before.

// emit delivers an entry to the per-client sink, if any, and to httplog.
//
// Both, not either: a client with a sink may still have the global capture on
// (--trace-http in the same process), and in that case the entry belongs in the
// OTel span events too. httplog.Emit is a no-op when capture is disabled, so
// the sink-only case costs one atomic load.
