// bytesPerToken converts a serialized request body to an input-token estimate.
//
// Measured, not assumed. 22 requests were driven through the local
// agentgateway with `pi --mode print --trace-http` against
// agentgateway/gemini-3.8-flash, pairing each request's body length from the
// httplog entry with the gen_ai.usage.input_tokens the gateway logged for that
// same request; runs were tagged with a nonce in the prompt so the pairing is
// exact rather than by timestamp. Bodies spanned 47 KB to 605 KB, 11k to 220k
// input tokens:
//
//	all 22 samples          min 2.71   median 2.79   max 4.27
//	>=50k tokens (n=20)     min 2.71   median 2.75   max 3.12
//
// 2.7 is the conservative end of the range that matters. The ratio is not
// constant — a first request is mostly system prompt and tool definitions and
// runs near 4.3, but it falls and settles just above 2.7 once source code
// dominates the payload, which is exactly the regime that exhausts a token
// quota. Picking the low end over-charges the small requests, and that is the
// direction to be wrong in: under-counting causes the 429s this package
// exists to prevent, over-counting only costs throughput.
//
// This started as 4 — the ratio internal/memory and internal/tui use for plain
// text — and that was a real defect rather than a rounding error. At the
// measured 2.75, the 2,005,778 tokens that drew the original rejection were
// about 5.5 MB on the wire, which a divisor of 4 estimates at 1.38M: under the
// budget, so the limiter would have paced nothing and 429'd anyway.
