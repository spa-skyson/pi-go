// Package ctxwindow resolves the context window of the model a session runs
// against, which is the denominator every compaction threshold is measured in.
//
// It is deliberately separate from internal/autocompact, which consumes the
// number: resolving a window means asking internal/provider, and piagent is
// barred by TestPiagentStaysIsolated from reaching provider construction even
// transitively. Keeping the two apart lets piagent install the same compaction
// hook as the CLI without acquiring that dependency.

// AutoCompactConfig.Decide treats an unknown window as CompactionNone rather
// than guessing a percentage of nothing. Setting context_window in config.json
// is the escape hatch, and it wins over every other source, because the
// embedded catalog does not cover every provider's models.
